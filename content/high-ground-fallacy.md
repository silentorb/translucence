# High Ground Fallacy

A high ground fallacy occurs when someone challenges the validity of a worldview due to it containing a certain problem when the world view of the challenger contains that same problem.  (By problem I mean an seeming contradiction within a worldview that must be resolved as either a paradox or a logical flaw.)

For someone to employ this fallacy, he must generally be unaware that his own world view contains the said problem.

Sometimes when a high ground fallacy is employed, the problem has a reasonable solution within the challenged worldview and thus is only a paradox, while the problem has no solution in the challenger's worldview.  In such cases, the challenger is using slight-of-hand to wield the flaws of his own worldview as weapons.

A high ground fallacy must be distinguished from the similar case of someone requiring someone else to account for a mutually shared and acknowledged worldview problem.   Such a case is not contradictory on the challenger's part, because the challenger is not suggesting that his own worldview does not possess that problem, nor that a worldview is automatically disproven by its presence.
