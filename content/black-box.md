A black box is anything that you know what it does, but you don't know how it does it. A child can happily turn on the TV and watch it without having any understanding of the circuitry and scientific principles being harnessed to generate the images and sounds the tv produces.

Imagine a black box that, whenever someone puts an apple into the input slot of the box, a fish comes out the output slot of the box. You see point A and you see point Z, but you have no idea what is taking place in the middle. Maybe the black box has a collection of fish and spits one out every time you insert an apple. Maybe it rearranges the molecular structure of the apple and transforms it into a fish. Maybe the box uses some force you don't know anything about to produce a fish, i.e, additional black boxes are contained within the outer black box. But all of that would simply be speculation, because ultimately you don't know what is going on within the black box. A black box is incomprehensible.

There is another type of box, the cardboard box. You can see inside it.  It is comprehensible.

 If someone were to say "When I put an apple into this cardboard box, instead of having an apple, I gain a fish.", he would be breaking the law of causality.  The properties of the cardboard box are evident, and it contains no properties that suggests it could produce a fish from an apple.

 However, it would not break the law of casuality to say, "When I put an apple into this black box, instead of having an apple, I gain a fish."  That statement is appealing to an unidentified force.  The existence of such a force is scientifically provable in that the process of apple -> fish is observable and reproducible.
