Imagine a cable.  A very long cable.  Each end of the cable is permanently attached to a wall.  The contents of the cable are strewn about the yard in a terrible mess.

Somewhere in this cable is a knot.  The location of the knot is impossible to discern amidst the chaos.

If someone were to organize the cable, such as forming a circular pile beside each of the walls, eventually the location of the knot would be revealed somewhere in the middle.

From there, the person could then move the knot anywhere along the cable, but no matter where he moved it, the cable would still contain a knot.

Now imagine the cable runs through a black box. The black box has the mysterious property of removing any knot that passes through it.

Now imagine that two people with two separate yards have the exact same configuration of cable, walls, and black box, with the cable starting off in a complete mess.  The first person organizes their cable to clearly reveal the knot and then moves the knot through the black box, causing the knot to vanish.  The first person claims the knot is gone.

The second person challenges the validity of the black box, claiming that because neither person knows what force caused the knot to vanish, the first person must be wrong.  However, lack of knowledge in itself does not disprove possibility, and in cases like these, the second person rarely clarifies whether it is the ability of the black box or lack of a knot that is being challenged.

Meanwhile, the second person's cable has a knot of its own. The second person believes his cable has no knot because his cable is so tangled the knot is not obvious. (Or should I say knot obvious?)

The second person is committing a specific form of high-ground fallacy, the knotted-cable fallacy.
